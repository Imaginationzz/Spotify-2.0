General Notes for index.html

-I linked the homepage btn to Homepage.html 
-I linked the "Your Library" btn to Artist Page
-The player only has one song that plays if you cick on the play btn in the player OR in the album page. 
-as for 00:18 of 30/10 the volume and the progress bar are not working
-as for the same time and date the tracks are a bit messy and unordered
-the page is responsive to mobile, however avoid showing certain screens because the sizing would need more work and more media queries. 
    Suggested devices: 
    Vertical: 
        Pixel 2 / 2 XL
        iPhone 6 / 7 / 8 / plus / X 
    Horizontal: 
        iPad 
        iPad Pro (kinda lol)
    
    Others behave weirdly or are ugly to look Artist

-if the mobile version starts to behave weird and not fit in the page try refreshing
